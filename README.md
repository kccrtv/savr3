# Savr App 3.0

### Project 4/Capstone for General Assembly's remote Software Engineering Immersive program

> The Savr App 3.0 elevates the [original Savr dev App](https://savr-dev-app.herokuapp.com/) by allowing user login via token-based authentication and external accounts by integrating Google Firebase and Firestore. The app uses third-party API data and React Router for navigation features. This is a recipe search app, from [Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).
